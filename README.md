# MNK Game

## Overview

The following program (`main.py`) was part of the examination of a module at my university.
This repository contains the implementation of the mnk game in Python. mnk is a classic board game where two players take turns to place their marks on an mxn board, and the first player to get k marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

## Features

- **Customizable board size (mxn) and winning criteria (k).**
- **Two-player mode:** Play against a friend or an AI.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Train an AI agent using a neural network.
